# AAPL-Stock-Prediction-and-Forecasting
 Certainly! Here's a description of the ## Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM  This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. The code is written in Python and utilizes the TensorFlow and Keras libraries for building and training the LSTM model.  ### Contents  1. `train_model.py`: This script demonstrates how to train an LSTM model on historical stock price data. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture definition, training, and saving the trained model to a file (`best_model.h5`).  2. `predict_future.py`: This script showcases how to use the trained LSTM model to predict stock prices for the next 10 days. It loads the trained model from `best_model.h5`, preprocesses input data, performs predictions, and outputs the predicted stock prices.  ### Usage  1. **Training the Model (`train_model.py`)**     To train the LSTM model on historical stock price data, follow these steps:        - Prepare your historical stock price dataset (not included in this repository).    - Adjust the data preprocessing and hyperparameters in the script according to your dataset and preferences.    - Run the script using `python train_model.py`.     After training, the script will save the trained model as `best_model.h5`.  2. **Predicting Future Stock Prices (`predict_future.py`)**     To predict future stock prices using the trained LSTM model, follow these steps:        - Make sure you have the trained model file `best_model.h5` in the same directory.    - Run the script using `python predict_future.py`.        The script will load the trained model, preprocess input data, perform predictions for the next 10 days, and output the predicted stock prices.  ### Note  Remember to replace placeholder comments in the code with your actual data and preferences. Additionally, make sure to have the required libraries (`numpy`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, etc.) installed in your environment.  Feel free to customize the code, add more features, or experiment with different model architectures to improve the predictions.  ---  You can use this description as a starting point for your GitHub repository's README file to provide an overview of the project and how to use the code.
