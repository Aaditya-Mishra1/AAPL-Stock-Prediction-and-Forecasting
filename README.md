## Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This repository contains Python code for predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. The TensorFlow and Keras libraries are employed to build, train, and use the LSTM model for stock price prediction.

### Contents

1. `train_model.py`: This script demonstrates how to train an LSTM model on historical stock price data. It covers data preprocessing, model architecture definition, training, and the process of saving the trained model to a file named `best_model.h5`.

2. `predict_future.py`: This script showcases how to utilize the trained LSTM model to predict stock prices for the upcoming 10 days. The script loads the trained model from `best_model.h5`, preprocesses input data, generates predictions, and outputs the predicted stock prices.

### Usage

#### 1. Training the Model (`train_model.py`)

To train the LSTM model on historical stock price data, follow these steps:

- Prepare your historical stock price dataset (not included in this repository).
- Adjust data preprocessing and hyperparameters within the script according to your dataset and preferences.
- Run the script using `python train_model.py`. After training, the script will save the trained model as `best_model.h5`.

#### 2. Predicting Future Stock Prices (`predict_future.py`)

To predict future stock prices using the trained LSTM model, perform the following steps:

- Ensure that the trained model file `best_model.h5` is present in the same directory.
- Execute the script using `python predict_future.py`. The script will load the trained model, preprocess input data, generate predictions for the next 10 days, and display the predicted stock prices.

### Note

Make sure to replace placeholder comments in the code with your actual data and preferences. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary libraries (such as numpy, tensorflow, keras, etc.) installed in your environment. Feel free to customize the code, add additional features, or experiment with different model architectures to enhance prediction accuracy.

You can use this description as a template for your GitHub repository's README file to provide a comprehensive overview of the project and guide users on how to utilize the provided code.
